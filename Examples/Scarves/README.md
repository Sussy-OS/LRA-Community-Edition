# How to create a custom Scarf
Navigate to your documents folder > LRA > Scarves and create a new text document. Name it the name you wish the scarf to have.

This is the layout for a custom scarf:
```
#LRTran Scarf File
[Hex color], [opacity]
[Hex color], [opacity]
[Hex color], [opacity]
[Hex color], [opacity]
...
```
You can apply this scarf in LRA:CE in Preferences > LRTran > Rider Settings > Selected Scarf.

Example: Rainbow.txt

```
#LRTran Scarf File
0xE40303, 0xff
0xFF8C00, 0xff
0xFFED00, 0xff
0x008026, 0xff
0x004DFF, 0xff
0x750787, 0xff
```
